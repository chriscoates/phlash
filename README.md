Phlash is a photo-messaging iPhone app that encourages spontaneity. Swipe right to capture an image and immediately send it to your phollowers. Swipe left to see phlashes sent by the people you're phollowing. No liking, commenting, sharing - see the phlash while it lasts!

## Authors

Phlash is the idea of a group of [Makers](http://www.makersacademy.com/) as its final project. The Kings and Queen of Phlash are:

 * [Chris Coates](https://github.com/chriscoates)
 * [Sergio Enrech Trillo](https://github.com/tigretoncio)
 * [Ollie Haydon-Mulligan](https://github.com/ollieh-m)
 * [Amy Nicholson](https://github.com/missamynicholson)

## Usage

The code is available to download from this repo, and as of 24-June-16 the app has been approved by Apple, so it is now ready for Beta testing. If you would like to beta test the app, please send and email to phlashapp@gmail.com or [check here.](https://phlash.herokuapp.com/)

## Technologies

Phlash has been developed for Apple devices, (iOS 9.0+), using XCode 7.3.1 and Swift 2.2. The backend service is provided by Parse and uses CloudCode, implemented in JavaScript, to secure user data and exchanges.  

The app has been also tested on IoS device as old as 7.0, although some compatibility issues have been experienced when retrieving pictures. For best user experience iOS 9.0 is recommended.

## Challenges

This is an amazing team. Not having enough with being challenged during 4 months coding like crazy in Ruby and Javascript, the PHLASH team decided they wanted to know how to develop a *"Phlashy app"* to show how much they could learn in very little time, (exactly 12 days), so they could share pics of [Dougal the Poodle](http://i.imgur.com/0pCDeFB.png?1), [Mabel](http://i.imgur.com/ZI8mXE7.jpg), the notorious [Sergio's neighbour cat](http://i.imgur.com/e6TL1Sr.png), or even [the mother duck-er](http://i.imgur.com/aTSMhz9.png)

None of the team knew about Swift before the start of the project, although Amy was a bit familiar with Xcode.  To make matters even more interesting, some of the members hadn't used a Mac in their lives before this project! (Sergio, we know who you are!)

We took a day to evaluate different mobile technologies, and we decided to go for Swift. Then, the challenge was to learn enough Swift and relevant tools (XCode and Parse) to create our app, and do it fast.

Another challenge was to decide features we wanted for the app, and oversee the deployment using Agile practices. We heavily relied on [Github](https://github.com) and [Waffle](https://waffle.io) to project manage the app development.

Also using a TDD philosophy was challenging as we needed to understand the programming language and its test framework in order to create relevant tests driving the app development, for that we spent another 2 days making a "spike". TDD-ing in XCode was another interesting challenge, but that's probably another story and we could write a trilogy with it...
